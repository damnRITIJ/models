# HI!
# This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: 
# Normal and Pneumonia.



# 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into two main folders:
train/
├── normal/
├── pneumonia/

test/
├── normal/
├── pneumonia/

Each class folder contains respective X-ray images.

# Model Overview
- Regularisation ,Early stopping and data augmentation were used to improve performance.


# 📊 Results

- **Training Set**: 74 images each for normal and pneumonia
- **Testing Set**: 20 images each for normal and pneumonia
- Model achieved **high accuracy** on the test set (you can update with the exact value if available)
- Learning curves suggest minimal overfitting and good generalization
